- ***lib***: It contains the scripts

- ***Example_notebook***: It contains some examples of the functions available in 'lib'

- ***Exams***: It contains some exam exercises

> **NOTE (1):** Most of the functions in 'lib' are NOT documented properly (sorry about that), however, the examples in 'Example_notebook" should be enough to undenstand how they work.

> **NOTE (2):** This "library" has been developed starting by the scripts provided by Sveva Pepe, her scripts are available in "Scripts" folder.

> **NOTE (3):** <mark>Warning</mark>: Some scripts may not work properly or they contain some bugs.

> **NOTE (4):** Inside 'lib' there are also sripts useful for Robotics2, such as the implementation of SNS method.

**It would be great to improve this library, for example by adding documentation inside each function, if you want to contribute please let us known in Robotics1 Telegram group :)**
